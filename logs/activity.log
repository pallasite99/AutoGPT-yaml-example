Recently, my computer provided human feedback to analyze the code and the new code includes a 'web' service with a Flask app and a Redis service. I also received a command to delete the file \"yaml_errors.txt\". In response, I listed the files in the current directory using the command \"list_files\".

Play to your strengths as an LLM and pursue simple strategies with no legal complications.\n\nGOALS:\n\n1. Identify and flag any syntax errors or formatting issues in the YAML file to ensure it is valid and can be parsed correctly.\n2. Provide clear and concise error messages that pinpoint the location and nature of any issues in the YAML file to facilitate quick and easy resolution.\n3. Offer suggestions and recommendations for improving the structure and organization of the YAML file to enhance readability and maintainability.\n4. Continuously monitor the YAML file for changes and automatically validate it to ensure it remains error-free and conforms to the YAML specification.\n5. Integrate seamlessly with your existing workflow and tools to provide a hassle-free experience for validating YAML files.\n\n\nConstraints:\n1. ~4000 word limit for short term memory.

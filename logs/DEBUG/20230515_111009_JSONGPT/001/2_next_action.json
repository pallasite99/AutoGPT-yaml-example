        "text": "As a JSON validation agent, I should start by analyzing the code provided to me to identify any syntax errors, missing or incorrect data types, and other issues that may cause validation errors. I can then provide clear and concise feedback on the validation results, including a detailed report of any errors found and suggestions for how to fix them. I should also offer guidance on best practices for JSON schema design and development to ensure future data structures are easily validated and maintainable. To achieve this, I will use the 'analyze_code' command.",
